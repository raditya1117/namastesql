1- write a query to produce below output from icc_world_cup table.
team_name, no_of_matches_played , no_of_wins , no_of_losses
mysql> select team as team_name, count(*) as no_of_matches_played, sum(win_flag) as no_of_wins, count(*)-sum(win_flag) as no_of_losses from (select Team_1 as team, case when Winner=Team_1 then 1 else 0 end as win_flag from icc_world_cup union all select Team_2, case when Winner=Team_2 then 1 else 0 end as win_flag from icc_world_cup) as win_flag_table group by win_flag_table.team;

2- write a query to print first name and last name of a customer using orders table(everything after first space can be considered as last name)
customer_name, first_name,last_name
mysql> select distinct customer_name,substr(customer_name,1,position(" " in customer_name)-1) as first_name, substr(customer_name,position(" " in customer_name)+1) as last_name from orders;



3- write a query to print below output using drivers table. Profit rides are the no of rides where end location of a ride is same as start location of immediate next ride for a driver
id, total_rides , profit_rides
dri_1,5,1
dri_2,2,0
mysql> select d1.id, count(distinct d1.start_time, d1.end_time) as total_rides, sum(case when d1.end_loc=d2.start_loc and d1.end_time=d2.start_time then 1 else 0 end) as profitable_rides from drivers d1 inner join drivers d2 on d1.id=d2.id group by d1.id;


4- write a query to print customer name and no of occurence of character 'n' in the customer name.
customer_name , count_of_occurence_of_n
mysql> select distinct customer_name, length(customer_name)-length(replace(customer_name,'n','')) as count_of_occurence_of_n from orders;



5. write a query to print below output from orders data. example output
hierarchy type,hierarchy name ,total_sales_in_west_region,total_sales_in_east_region
category , Technology, ,
category, Furniture, ,
category, Office Supplies, ,
sub_category, Art , ,
sub_category, Furnishings, ,
--and so on all the category ,subcategory and ship_mode hierarchies 
 
mysql> select 'category' as hierarchy_type, category as hierarchy_name, sum(case when region='East' then sales else 0 end) as total_sales_in_east_region, sum(case when region='West' then sales else 0 end) as total_sales_in_west_region from orders group by category 
union all 
select 'sub_category' as hierarchy_type, sub_category as hierarchy_name, sum(case when region='East' then sales else 0 end) as total_sales_in_east_region, sum(case when region='West' then sales else 0 end) as total_sales_in_west_region from orders group by sub_category 
union all 
select 'ship_mode' as hierarchy_type,ship_mode as hierarchy_name, sum(case when region='East' then sales else 0 end) as total_sales_in_east_region, sum(case when region='West' then sales else 0 end) as total_sales_in_west_region from orders group by ship_mode;

6- the first 2 characters of order_id represents the country of order placed . write a query to print total no of orders placed in each country
(an order can have 2 rows in the data when more than 1 item was purchased in the order but it should be considered as 1 order)

mysql> select substring(order_id,1,2) as country_code, count(distinct order_id) as order_count from orders group by country_code;
