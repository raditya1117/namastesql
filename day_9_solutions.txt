1- write a query to find premium customers from orders data. Premium customers are those who have done more orders than average no of orders per customer.
mysql> with order_avg_cte as (select customer_id,count(distinct order_id) as num_orders from orders group by customer_id) select customer_id from order_avg_cte where num_orders > (select avg(num_orders) from order_avg_cte);

mysql> with customer_order_cte as (select customer_id, count(distinct order_id)
as order_count from orders group by customer_id) select customer_id from customer_order_cte where order_count>(select avg(order_count) from customer_order_cte);

2- write a query to find employees whose salary is more than average salary of employees in their department.
mysql> with avg_salary_cte as (select dept_id, avg(salary) as avg_salary from employee group by dept_id) select emp_id, emp_name from employee e inner join avg_salary_cte a on e.dept_id=a.dept_id where e.salary>a.avg_salary;

mysql> with average_salary_cte as (select dept_id, avg(salary) as average_salary from employee group by dept_id) select emp_name from employee inner join average_salary_cte on employee.dept_id = average_salary_cte.dept_id where employee.salary>average_salary_cte.average_salary;

3- write a query to find employees whose age is more than average age of all the employees.
mysql> select emp_id, emp_name from employee where emp_age>(select avg(emp_age) from employee);

mysql> select emp_name from employee where emp_age>(select avg(emp_age) from employee);

4- write a query to print emp name, salary and dep id of highest salaried employee in each department 
mysql> with max_sal_cte as (select dept_id, max(salary) as max_sal from employee group by dept_id) select e.emp_name as employee_name, e.salary as salary, e.dept_id as dept_id from employee e inner join max_sal_cte m on e.dept_id=m.dept_id where e.salary=m.max_sal;

mysql> with highest_salary_cte as (select dept_id, max(salary) as highest_salary from employee group by dept_id) select e.emp_name, e.dept_id, e.salary from employee e inner join highest_salary_cte h on e.dept_id=h.dept_id where e.salary=h.highest_salary;


5- write a query to print emp name, salary and dep id of highest salaried overall
mysql> select emp_name, salary, dept_id from employee where salary=(select max(salary) from employee);

mysql> select emp_name, salary, dept_id from employee where salary=(select max(salary) from employee);


6- write a query to print product id and total sales of highest selling products (by no of units sold) in each category.
mysql> with count_cte as (select category,product_id, sum(quantity) as sales_count from orders group by category, product_id), category_max_count_cte as (select category, max(sales_count) as max_sales_category from count_cte group by category), product_count_cte as ( sele
ct product_id from count_cte c inner join category_max_count_cte cm on c.category=cm.category where c.sales_count=cm.max_sales_category)
 select o.product_id, sum(sales) as total_sales from orders o inner join product_count_cte p on o.product_id=p.product_id group by o.product_id;



mysql> with count_cte as (select category,product_id, sum(quantity) as order_count, sum(sales) as total_sales from orders group by category, product_id),max_cte as (select category, max(order_count) as max_count from count_cte group by category) select product_id, total_sales from count_cte inner join max_cte on count_cte.category=max_cte.category where max_cte.max_count=count_cte.order_count;

with confirmed_cte as (select * from texts where signup_action='Confirmed'),
all_cte as (select e.user_id, c.signup_action from emails e LEFT JOIN confirmed_cte c on c.email_id=e.email_id)
select round(avg(case when signup_action is null then 0 else 1 end),2) from all_cte;

with confirmed_cte as (SELECT distinct(e.email_id) FROM emails e left join texts t 
on e.email_id=t.email_id 
where t.signup_action='Confirmed')

select round((count(c.email_id)*1.0/count(e.email_id)),2) from emails e left join confirmed_cte c on e.email_id=c.email_id;

FROM customer_contracts c inner join products p 
on c.product_id=p.product_id GROUP BY c.customer_id, p.product_category
having sum(c.amount)>0)
select customer_id from category_count_cte 
GROUP BY customer_id
having count(distinct product_category)=(select count(DISTINCT product_category) from products);
